## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
I deal with a ton of data and sometimes remembering what I named a given file that I need, with 8 years of files on my work harddrive, isn't very easy. If the data is sufficiently unique, this allows me to find files slightly easier than the alternative method. 
This project leverages pandas.


The expected frequency for running this code is As Needed.
